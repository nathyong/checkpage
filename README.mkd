checkpage
=========

A daemonised utility for checking the updates of online pages, written in
Haskell.


Usage
-----

`checkpage [-l LOGIN_URL] URL` will grab a copy of the `URL`, by first logging
into the page at `LOGIN_URL`.  If this is the first time the utility has been
run, it will save a copy of the important parts of the page (yet to be
decided), and on subsequent runs of the utility it will notify you if there has
been a change in the page's content.
